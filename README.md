- "Grid Point Code" (GPC) gives unique global identification to homes, offices and all other places.
- Encodes pinpoint location into alphanumeric characters.
- Lossless decoding from GPC to geographic coordinates
- Encodes geographic coordinates with precision up to 5 decimal places.
- GPC has unique format #xxxx-xxxx-xxx for easy recognisability.
- Similar GPCs are closer than different codes.
- Geographic coordinates to GPC and back can be converted completely offline.
- GPC library is an open source and can be used without restrictions.
